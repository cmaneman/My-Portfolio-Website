# Personal-Website-File
This Project was created in Notepad++ during my Junior year at University of Maryland Eastern Shore.
This Project was assigned to my class to practice creating personel websites.
This is a Resume Website in HTML5 and CSS# and has yet to be updated and uploaded to the internet.
